      <p> This website was developed to help cheer up children in difficult situations because of a disablity</br>
          or cripiling illness at the Hack Manchester event in 2017. The website is based around other people</br>
          cheerin up those who struggle go out with friends and have a social life. The site alows people to send messages</br>
          and links to people in the form of "gifts". The recipient can then reply and/or start a conversation</br>
          with this person. </p>
      <p>We hope this website will help get people connected with others in a similar situation or give them something</br>
         to look forward to.It also helps them make friends and talk to people. This is a very basic version of the</br>
         website and we hope to add extra features.</p>
